# Code to Rome
## All roads lead to Rome

The goal of this project is to prove once and for all that there are many, many ways to achieve the same application functionality using different programming languages, tools, and technologies. So many developers ask the question "which programming language, which cloud, which database, which ...." should I learn.  The answer is it really doesn't matter, what is more important is developing a solid foundation and understanding of key programming principles and fundamentals that you can carry with you throughout your career.  Let's show ["All Roads Lead to Rome"](https://grammarist.com/proverb/all-roads-lead-to-rome/)   

### How this will work
We will utilize SCRUM methodology and have a set of user stories that will act as the requirements for an application.  I will try to build the application using our requirements using a specific programming language and set of tools.  I will showcase end-to-end lifecycle of application including design, coding, build, test, and deploying to various clouds.  As we go on, I am open to more people contributing and adding other programming languages to show building the **SAME** application.  Along the way, I will talk about how I arrive at design decisions, key fundamental concepts, and try to highlight as many "real-world" points as I can. At the end of each "sprint", we will have what's called a Retrospective where we will talk and share pros and cons and lessons learned.
